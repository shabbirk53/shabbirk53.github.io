        "abstract": "The automatic assessment of hippocampus volume is an important tool in the study of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Specifically, the measurement of hippocampus subfields properties is of great interest since it can show earlier pathological changes in the brain. However, segmentation of these subfields is very difficult due to their complex structure and the need for high-resolution magnetic resonance images manually labeled. In this work, we present a novel pipeline for automatic hippocampus subfield segmentation based on a deeply supervised convolutional neural network. Results of the proposed method are shown for two available hippocampus subfield delineation protocols. The method has been compared to other state-of-the-art methods showing improved results in terms of accuracy and execution time.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a type of brain disease that makes it hard for someone to perform daily tasks. Early diagnosis and classification of the condition are thought to be essential study areas due to the speedy progression of the disease in people living with dementia and the absence of precise diagnostic procedures. One of the main aims of the researchers is to correctly identify the early stages of AD so that the disease can be prevented or significantly reduced. The main objective of the current review is to thoroughly examine the most recent work on early AD detection and classification using the deep learning (DL) approach. This paper examined the purpose of an early diagnosis of AD, the various neuroimaging modalities, the pre-processing methods that were employed, the maintenance of data, the deep learning used in classifying AD from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, the publicly available datasets, and the data that were fed into the deep models. A comparative analysis of different classification methods using DL techniques is performed. Further, the paper discussed the challenges involved in AD detection.",
